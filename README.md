# Orbital-Trade-Transponder
A forked version of the SF Orbital Trader Transponder mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023111461.

This mod allows you to craft an orbital trader transponder to immediately call an orbital trader to you.
    
In this version, the recipe has been rebalanced and an upfront silver cost to call the trader has been added to
make up for the fact that it can be reused. This cost can be customized in the mod's settings.

This mod now requires HugsLib. It must be placed below HugsLib to function.

Credit to Mehni and Shotgunfrenzy for the original mod, and rselbo for the 1.1 update this forked is based off of.
