    Tired of waiting for a damn orbital trader to show up?

    Forgot to edit your scenario to make them appear every couple of days/quadrums, and didn't want to resort to dev mode?

    We have the solution for you. A new-fandangled artifact that calls an orbital trader to your location, no bullshit, just use and boom, orbital trader ready to take your shit and rain down silver.

    How to get such an item you may ask?

    Just crack open an Ancient Danger or ask a shaman merchant to stock you one.

    Too hard? Well this handy piece of work can also be crafted with 700 silver, 10 components, 30 steel and 40 plasteel.

    Happy trading ya raider loving hecks!!!
